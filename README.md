# Motif Finder in DNA Sequence

This project is a simple Python script that identifies and visualizes the positions of a specific motif in a given DNA sequence.

## Overview

The script performs the following tasks:

1. **Importing Required Libraries:**
   - The matplotlib.pyplot library is imported to create visualizations.

2. **Defining DNA Sequence and Motif:**
   - A DNA sequence and a motif to search for within the sequence are defined as strings.

3. **Finding Motif Positions:**
   - A function named find_motifs is defined to search for the motif within the DNA sequence. The positions of the motif are stored in a list called positions.

4. **Printing the Motif Positions:**
   - The positions where the motif is found in the DNA sequence are printed to the console.

5. **Visualizing the Motif Positions:**
   - A plot is created to visualize the positions of the motif in the DNA sequence using vertical lines.
